                    <p align="justify">Perspective is the biggest thing. Narrative is my version of what i saw or heard. One main difference that i see between drama and narrative is the difference of viewpoint. Susan glaspell wrote a narrative and a play that tell the same story. The main difference between play and musical is that a play is when a story is narrated.</p>
